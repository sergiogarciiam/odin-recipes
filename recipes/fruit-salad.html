    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are
      never leftovers! This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I
      think the citrusy sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the longer
      you can let it soak in its juices. I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the
      refrigerator before I serve it.

        Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5
        minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Set aside to
        cool.
