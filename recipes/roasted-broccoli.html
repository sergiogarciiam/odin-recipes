    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Roasted broccoli is easy to make and so much more flavorsome than boiled.
      My favorite part is the roasted sliced stem pieces.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>14 ounces broccoli</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into
        1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl
        and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly
        browned, about 18 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
